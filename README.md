## How to launch the app

The following are the steps to build the app. It is necessary to create an EC2 on AWS.

## EC2 Settup

Create an EC2 in AWS, create the necesary ssh files to connect, connect to it and then:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

Inside this repository, among the variables and secrets there is one called **IPADDR**, replace this variable with the IP generated by AWS for the EC2.

There is also **SSH_KEY**, replace this value with the value of the private key used to connect by ssh to the EC2.
